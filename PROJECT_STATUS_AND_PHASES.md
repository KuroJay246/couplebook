## Approved-Account Smoke Status

| Check | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Overall gate | `HOLD` |
| Jaylan authenticated smoke actually run | yes |
| Partner authenticated smoke actually run | no |
| Guest blocked in current source/unsigned checks | yes |
| Signup disabled | yes |
| Username login disabled | yes |
| Destructive browser admin tools disabled | yes |

### Why Smoke Is Still HOLD

Jaylan was successfully tested in a real browser session after correcting the live Jaylan UID mismatch in Firestore rules. The smoke gate is still `HOLD` because the partner account was not available for testing, so the project still cannot honestly claim `PASS`.

## Open Gates

### Highest Gate

1. Real approved-account smoke for both approved users.

### Architecture Gate

2. Replace collection-wide `users` reads/listeners only after smoke passes.

### UI Gate

3. Keep live redesign work behind route/auth/sync safety confirmation.

### Storage Gate

4. Do not initialize Storage until approved-account smoke passes and a first-upload plan is explicitly approved.

## What Is Blocked

- any claim that authenticated strict-rules behavior is fully closed
- risky live `firestoreSync` replacement while smoke is `HOLD`
- Storage initialization or media migration
- broad live UI shell replacement

## What Can Continue Safely

- documentation cleanup and handbook consolidation
- QA automation improvements
- non-live sync modeling
- non-live prototype refinement
- service-layer planning
- page-by-page redesign planning

## Recent Phase Closeout Summaries

### Latest Workstream Run Summary

- starting commit: `a87effdd1742bf52be2efe53b8b26d3494c6ecaf`
- Phase 9 track: safety baseline stayed green, live Firestore rules were corrected for the real Jaylan UID, Jaylan approved-account smoke passed in a real browser session, and overall smoke remained honestly `HOLD` because the partner account was not tested
- Phase 10 track: skipped live sync work because smoke did not pass
- Phase 11 track: no new prototype work in this human-assisted smoke batch
- checks run: `git status --short --branch`, `git rev-parse main`, `git rev-parse origin/main`, `npm run check:all`, `npm run check:rules`, master-doc review, smoke runbook review, Firestore rules-only deploy, and real browser-authenticated Jaylan page checks
- commits in this run:
  - pending smoke/status documentation commit
- deploy activity: Firestore rules only
- private media touched: no
- remaining top gate: partner approved-account smoke plus blocked-behavior re-check in the post-fix browser session
- next recommended track actions:
  - Phase 9: run the partner approved-account smoke and finish the blocked-behavior check
  - Phase 10: keep live sync replacement blocked until smoke passes
  - Phase 11: stay paused until the smoke gate is fully closed or explicitly deprioritized

### Phase 8 Summary

- refreshed baseline and kept smoke honest
- added `authService` wrappers
- mapped the Firestore sync boundary
- expanded QA checks
- expanded the non-live shell prototype
- documented closeout and next queue

Phase 8 commits:

| Commit | Summary |
| --- | --- |
| `26a5a74` | auth service wrapper |
| `9c9c796` | sync boundary mapping |
| `2ef0fec` | QA expansion |
| `2a994c5` | prototype expansion |
| `ba04acf` | closeout and next queue |

### Phase 9 Summary

- kept smoke at `HOLD`
- designed the document-scoped sync replacement
- added non-live sync model helpers and `check:sync-model`
- converted prototype and redesign planning into production checklists
- documented memory-domain and curation planning
- documented closeout and next long-run prompt

Phase 9 commits:

| Commit | Summary |
| --- | --- |
| `931e892` | sync replacement design |
| `e074e3b` | sync model helpers |
| `2c3c18c` | production shell planning |
| `d1d859a` | memory-domain planning |
| `9bc974d` | closeout and next long run |

## Workstream Phase Model

### Phase 9: Maintenance / Safety / QA Corrections

Use `9A`, `9B`, `9C`, and so on for:

- QA fixes
- runtime errors
- mirror drift
- service guardrail fixes
- `check:all` failures
- documentation cleanup
- smoke status updates

### Phase 10: Backend / Sync / Service Layer

Use `10A`, `10B`, `10C`, and so on for:

- auth service improvements
- sync replacement
- service-layer cleanup
- root/public strategy
- Firestore model cleanup

### Phase 11: UI / Redesign / Product Experience

Use `11A`, `11B`, `11C`, and so on for:

- production shell planning
- design token cleanup
- dashboard redesign
- timeline redesign
- gallery/profile/favorites/settings redesign
- special page integration

### Phase 12: Storage / Media Migration

Use `12A`, `12B`, `12C`, and so on later for:

- Storage initialization review
- media metadata introduction
- controlled upload/migration batches

### Phase 13: Future Framework Migration

Use `13A`, `13B`, `13C`, and so on only if explicitly approved for:

- source-of-truth restructuring
- build-pipeline introduction
- Vite/React migration

## Parallel Work Rule

These tracks may move in parallel only when safe.

Examples:

- Phase 9 can fix `check:all` or documentation hygiene
- Phase 10 can continue service/sync planning
- Phase 11 can continue non-live design or implementation planning

If Phase 9 finds a serious safety or runtime failure, it pauses Phase 10 and Phase 11 until fixed.

Do not create new phase docs unless the master docs cannot handle the topic cleanly.

### Reporting Rule

Future long-run reports should be grouped by track:

- Phase 9 track
- Phase 10 track
- Phase 11 track

## Next Run Queue

### Phase 9 Track

- keep smoke status honest
- fix any `check:all` regressions
- keep docs and mirrors clean

### Phase 10 Track

- if smoke is still `HOLD`, stay in planning/non-live sync prep
- if smoke becomes `PASS`, prepare the smallest reversible live sync read replacement

### Phase 11 Track

- keep redesign in planning/checklist mode until sync and smoke gates are clearer

## Recommended Immediate Order

1. Run real approved-account smoke if credentials/session are available.
2. If both accounts pass, start the smallest live document-scoped sync read replacement only.
3. Otherwise continue Phase 9 and Phase 11 planning work without changing live sync or live shell behavior.
